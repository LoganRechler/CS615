Reviewed previous weeks' notes
Still have questions about why email addresses are so weird and can basically be anything
	is there any way to regulate them or at this point is it just too late?
Need to spend more time looking through my old notes
	lots of useful information in there
		whois vs ICANN
	interesting facts
		IPv4 was for experimentation, not actual use
