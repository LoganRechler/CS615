Pre-Class Notes
-------------------------------------------
The Attack Life Cycle:
	adversaries are dedicated human beings with specific objectives
	High Level Stages:
		Initial reconnaissance
			researches the target
			performs network scans
			identifies vulnerabilities
		Initial compromise
			identify and exploit a vulnerability to gain access to some systems
			establish a foothold
		Escalate privileges
			get higher/root privileges
		Internal recon and lateral movement
			step 1 again but from inside the system
		Complete mission

Post-Class Notes

Security is a trade-off
	political
Risk Assessment:
	identify assets
	identify threats
	identify vulnerabilities
	determine likelihood of damage
	esstimate cost of recovery
	estimate cost of defense

risk is the likelihood of a threat successfully exploiting a vulnerability and the estimated cost both in the short and long term you may incur as a result

systems can't be "secure"
	risks can online be minimized

Threat model:
	identify what you're protecting
	identify from whom you're protecting it
		identify goals of the attacker
		identify motivation of the attacker
		identify capabilities of the attacker
	identify threats you cannot defend against
Threat modeling process:
	identify assets, assign values
	use STRIDE to identify threats
	use DREAD+D to derive threat scores
	determine/recommend defenses
	zoom out/zoom in and repeat
