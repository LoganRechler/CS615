Before Class:
-----------------
Simple Request to a remote host
	Local host connects to remote host
		turn remote hostname into IP address
			determine how to resolve hostnames via /etc/nsswitch.conf
			look in /etc/hosts -> if that fails use DNS
			determine which DNS server to use via /etc/resolve.conf
			open socket to the predetermined port on the DNS, send query, receive response
		open socket to requested port on remote IP
	Local host sends data
	Remote host replies with data


ktrace allows you to trace other commands
	outputs in binary format
		use kdump command to read it

3 way tcp handshake:
	syn
	syn-ack
	ack


Physical/Link Layer
	Network hardware and device drivers
	cables
Network layer
	basic communication, addressing, routing
Transport layer
	delivery of data to applications
Application layer
	end-user applications
APR (address resolution protocol)
	who-has is broadcasted
	is-at is unicast
Gratuitous ARP
	a is-at reply that nobody asked for, typically sent when a new interface comes up
ARP is only in IPv4
ndp=Neighbor discovery table
	neighbor solicitation (who has) is multicast
	neighbor advertizement (tgt is) to global unicast address
	takes place in the network layer
ICMP
	ping (IPv4)
		sends an echo request, receives an echo reply
		has a type (8 for a request, 0 for a reply), code field (always 0), a checksum, an identifier, a sequence number, and a data section
		the -p flag can be used to add data to the ping
			can be used to exfiltrate data 
	ping6 (IPv6)
		virtually identical to IPv4
