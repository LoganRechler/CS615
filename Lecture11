Pre-Class Notes
-------------------------------------------
Every server must be replaceable
	prevents a single point of failure
Document how you want servers/services to be set up
	allows you to automate the process with a CM (Configuration Manager)
System and service definitions are additive
	CMs need to determine and apply the appropriate union of the two
CM Requirements:
	needs to be able to install software on the host
		often relies on the package manager for this
	needs to determine which services are running and should be running on a given host
	set file permissions and ownership
	install static files
		such as /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts
	generate host-specific data
	command execution
States:
	unconfigured
		the CM is not installed or isn't running
	configured
		the CM has run successfully and applied the required changes
	in service
		the host has been put into production
	out of service
		explicitly been taken out of service, no longer serving production traffic
	deviant
		the host is no longer in the desired configuration state
	unknown
idempotent
	operations that can be run multiple times and will always produce the same results
CMs control themselves
	can cause problems
