Pre-class Notes
-----------------------------------
/etc/hosts may have been created from the Network Information Conrol Center (NIC)
First Unix name server was called BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) 1984
The root of the dns is "."
	Subdivides into zones such as arpa, come, edu, org, net, gov, etc
		These all are subdivided and the process continues
	Nodes have a label (name) and can have Resource Records (RR)
Resource Records
	IP address associations via the A or AAAA records
Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
	has a . at the end (i.e; www.cs.stevens.edu.)
	signals the tree that it does not need to continue going up
	some systems will break if they receive a trailing .
Fetch the top level file to see the number of TLDs:
	curl -s ftp://rs.internic.net/domain/root.zone
1504 TLDs as of March 16, 2021
IANA manages the root zone, delegates authority to other domain name registries
registries can censor, revoke, change, etc entries
if you control one node you control the subtree of that node
The DNS server we talk to is non-authoritative
	it asks other servers
lookup the name server responsible for the root zone via the dns:
	dig -t ns . | more
DNSSEC, DoT, and DoH each solve different threat models
DNS traffic is rarely restricted
-------------------------------------------------
Post-class Notes
------------------------------------------------
When doing a tcpdump of a dns use -n
DNSSEC requires a DNS key
Caching resolver:
	Asks the root who is responsible for .edu
	gets that back, asks edu who is responsible for stevens.edu
	
	Has the addresses of the 13 resolvers pre-configured
Your CDN:
	sees all your traffic
	controls your TLS certificate keys
	Your multi-tenant environment
	Might put restrictions on your clients
	Separation of cache my require multiple domains
