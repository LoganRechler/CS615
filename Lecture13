Pre-class notes
-------------------------------
signs of triviality:
It is still possible to regain/keep our pivacy
make it profitable for companies to be privacy preserving
lean on companies to implement these features
security software is developed by security nerds for security nerds

primum non nocere:
we are stewards of our users' data
we are obligated to act in the public interest
not like lawyers or doctors that have unified paths to become that role
	and subsequent unified code of ethics
most sysadmins have encountered ethical conflicts
