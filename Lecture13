Pre-class notes
-------------------------------
signs of triviality:
It is still possible to regain/keep our pivacy
make it profitable for companies to be privacy preserving
lean on companies to implement these features
security software is developed by security nerds for security nerds

primum non nocere:
we are stewards of our users' data
we are obligated to act in the public interest
not like lawyers or doctors that have unified paths to become that role
	and subsequent unified code of ethics
most sysadmins have encountered ethical conflicts
--------------------------------------
Post-Class Notes
--------------------------------------
sudo cat >/somewhere
	tries to write to /somewhere as a user
Shell Steps:
	split by whitespace
	i/o redirection
	execute commands
shell redirection can be anywhere in the command

similarities across different codes of ethics for tech:
	contribute to/protect society
	privacy of data
		data is a liability
		it's valuable but dangerous
	social and ethical responsibility
	important to keep yourself up to date on the latest technologies

sysadmins are privileged positions
	makes them targeted

when facing a dilema:
	get it in writing
	increase transparency
