Before Class:
------------------------------------
Whois:
One of the oldest internet protocols
	considered obsolete because it is considered unreliable
	still heavily relied upon
Designed to be human readable, not machine readable
	No standardized format
	No consistent fields
Became decentralized as the Internet grew larger
Requires you to know which registry (RIR) is responsible for the domain to query
	Only way to find out is really just to know, no standardized way of finding out
	Can try querying IANA for the responsible server
Conflict between the data requirement for registries and privacy laws such as GDPR
ICANN is trying to replace whois
	Difficult since everybody depends on it
	Wants to implement RDAP (registration data access protocol), which is RESTful and standardized

OSI:
	Physical
		actual hardware
	Link
		node-to-node communication
	Network
		packet transfers
	Transport
		most of TCP
	
	Session
	Presentation
	Application

	Session and Presentation are where a lot of confusion is

	Financial and political
		pays for everything
IPv4 is complicated, has a lot of fields
	version, IHL, type of service, total length, identification, flags, fragment offset, ttl, protocol, header checksum, source address, destination address, options, and padding

5 classes of IPv4
	Class A: leading bit 0
	Class B: leading bits 10
	Class C: leading bits 110
	Cladd D: leading bits 1110
	Class E: leading bits 1111

netmask splits an address into a network and host section


IPv6 is less complex:
	version, traffic class, flow control, payload length, next header, hop limit, source address, destination address
128 bit addresses
loopback address=::1
IPv4 mapped address=::ffff:74.6.143.25
Use brackets [] to separate ip and port

IPv4 being 32 bits was just for experimentation, wasn't expected to actually be used
IPv6 was introduced in 1995
