Before Class:
------------------------------------
Whois:
One of the oldest internet protocols
	considered obsolete because it is considered unreliable
	still heavily relied upon
Designed to be human readable, not machine readable
	No standardized format
	No consistent fields
Became decentralized as the Internet grew larger
Requires you to know which registry (RIR) is responsible for the domain to query
	Only way to find out is really just to know, no standardized way of finding out
	Can try querying IANA for the responsible server
Conflict between the data requirement for registries and privacy laws such as GDPR
ICANN is trying to replace whois
	Difficult since everybody depends on it
	Wants to implement RDAP (registration data access protocol), which is RESTful and standardized
