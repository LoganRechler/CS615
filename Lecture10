SAGE Booklet: Backups and Recovery:

Backup and disaster recovery system principles:
	1) Define acceptable loss
	2) Back up everything
	3) Organize
	4) Protect against disasters
	5) Document
	6) Test continually
Important to have physical security/organization for backups

Database backup and recovery:
	Difficult because databases are constantly changing
	The elements relate to one another
	Huge size
	Expensive

	Physical backup:
		cold backup:
			the database shuts down for the backup
		hot backup:
			backup done while the database is online
	Logical Backup:
		stores data objects not record data locations

SAN:
	two or more devices communicating via a serial SCSI protocol
	raw disks and tap drives
	allows different servers to access the same raw disk or tape drive
NAS:
	network attached storage
	filesystems
	allows different users to access the same filesystem or file
