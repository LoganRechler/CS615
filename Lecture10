SAGE Booklet: Backups and Recovery:

Backup and disaster recovery system principles:
	1) Define acceptable loss
	2) Back up everything
	3) Organize
	4) Protect against disasters
	5) Document
	6) Test continually
Important to have physical security/organization for backups

Database backup and recovery:
	Difficult because databases are constantly changing
	The elements relate to one another
	Huge size
	Expensive

	Physical backup:
		cold backup:
			the database shuts down for the backup
		hot backup:
			backup done while the database is online
	Logical Backup:
		stores data objects not record data locations

SAN:
	two or more devices communicating via a serial SCSI protocol
	raw disks and tap drives
	allows different servers to access the same raw disk or tape drive
NAS:
	network attached storage
	filesystems
	allows different users to access the same filesystem or file

Post-Class Notes:
--------------------------------------------------
HW:
	stipulate that when the backup starts anything written after that will not be backed up
	in the initial one you know how much data you need
	hard to know afterwards
		can have incremental (only backup changed stuff) vs a full backup
	Both
		might want to stipulate a max size
		can use compression
		use multiple EBS volumes and stitch them together
		split the data into parts and put them into separate EBS volumes

	write data to an ebs volume
		create an instance, create a volume, attach the volume, mount it
		can use a filesystem
			can copy the directory heirarchy into the filesystem
			has a lot of overhead
			required for incremental
		or write to the raw disk
			can just dump the data to the device
				but then can't selectively restore from it

	Local Steps:
		calculate the size that we need
		create an ec2 instance
			or require one to be running/specified
		create a volume (or re-use a volume)
		read data into the network
	Remote:
		read the data
		write it to the disk
	make the assumption that only 1 person is running it on 1 device at 1 time
	can also look for pre-existing tools
		or looking for something that uploads data to an ebs volume
	possibly run dump on the local side | ssh | dd (or tar) to the disk

Monitoring:
	goal is to make the needle (event) bigger, not the haystack (metrics)
	Graphs make it much easier for us to determine outliers
		mrtg is a tool to graph logs
	better to log counters/timers/averages rather than everything
		saves space
	if you know the baseline you can program triggers for outliers
	email is not a scalable network monitoring solution
		email is not instantaneous
			can sit on a server for days
	absence of a signal can be a signal
