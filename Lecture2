Before Class
-----------------------------------------
Get information about the file system:
	df -h /tmp
Fill up the available space:
	dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/big bs=1g
Look at file size:
	du -h /tmp/big
Setting the file size but not writing data to it creates a sparse file:
	Thinks it is big but doesn't actually use memory blocks
View inode information:
	df -i /tmp
Use up all of the inodes:
	fetch the program:
		curl -0 https://stevens.netmeister.org/615/mkfiles.c
	It creates a directory and loops forever creating new files in that directory until it fails
	compile:
		cc -Wall mkfiles.c
Useful commands to work with aws ecw:
	curl -o /tmp/awsaliases https://stevens.netmeister.org/615/awsaliases
	mv /tmp/awsaliases ~/.awsaliases
	echo "source ~/.awsaliases" >> ~/.bashrc

You can run a command directly as you ssh (ssh stevens bash)

Chapter 4: File Systems and Storage Models
	Direct Attached Storage:
		Hard drives are attached directly to the server
		Can't be accessed by other servers
	NAS (Network Attached Storage):
		Sits in a central location
		Makes it available over a network file system
	Storage Area networks:
		Scales better than NAS
		Allows different clients to access chunks of storage on block levels
	Cloud Storage:
		1) file level
		2) object level
		3) block level
	RAID (Redudant Array of Independent Disks):
		Increases total disk space, performance, and data redundancy
	File System Types:
		Disk File Systems:
			unix file system
		Distributed File Systems:
			different clients can access a centralized storage simultaneously (NAS)
		Other:
			Unix idea that everything is a file
